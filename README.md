# Simple REST API build with Flinj

I've created a simple sample application using [Flinj](https://www.npmjs.com/package/flinj) to demonstrate how easy and intuitive is to write REST API application using [Flinj](https://www.npmjs.com/package/flinj)

I'm using version 0.1.1 of [Flinj](https://www.npmjs.com/package/flinj) which is an experimental project. You definitely shouldn't try and use it, yet.
